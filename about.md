# About Me

I’ve taken a pretty winding path to get here, starting with a BA in Philosophy and Political Science, then an MA in Political Science, and a certificate in Quantitative Social Data Analysis. Somewhere between theory building, reading countless papers, and running regressions, I realized I love finding stories hidden inside data.

I’ve worked across research and sales, building online surveys, working on CRM's, mapping crime data, generating leads, analyzing social trends, and helping translate data into stories people can use. I’ve used R, SPSS, and ArcGIS, and I’m getting more comfortable with Python and SQL.

Alongside all that, I’m a student-athlete at UW–Milwaukee on the women’s track and field team (ask me about the metal rods drilled into my shin bones-airport security is exciting). The dynamic between working, training, and studying is no easy one!
