# About Me

I’m currently a master’s student in Data Science at UW–Milwaukee, with a background in Political Science, Philosophy, and Quantitative Social Data Analysis.  
I love using data to uncover stories about behavior, policy, and systems.

Alongside my academic work, I’m a student-athlete on the UW–Milwaukee Women’s Track and Field team.  
Ask me about the metal rods in my shin bones — they make airport security way more interesting.
