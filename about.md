# About Me

I am a data-driven thinker with an unconventional path into data science. I started in **philosophy** and **political science**, earned an **MA in Political Science**, completed a **certificate in Quantitative Social Data Analysis**, and now I’m a **master’s student in Data Science at UW–Milwaukee**.  
That mix of theory, modeling, and applied analytics gives me a perspective that’s a little different. I understand how people and institutions behave—and I know how to analyze, model, and interpret the data behind those behaviors. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

I’ve worked across research, analytics, and even sales roles, building surveys, analyzing nonprofit financial patterns, mapping crisis-call hotspots, studying political behavior, building CRM systems, producing scenario analyses, and translating findings into insights people can actually use. I’ve used tools like **R, SPSS, ArcGIS, Python, and SQL**, and I love work that blends technical depth with real-world impact. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

Right now, I’m working on two major projects:  
• **YouTube gaming engagement modeling** — exploring what makes certain videos take off using metadata patterns, language cues, thumbnails, and behavioral metrics.  
• **Foundation strategy research** — assessing how foundations respond to political and economic uncertainty and how they communicate those decisions publicly.

Outside of research, I’m a **student-athlete on the UW–Milwaukee women’s track & field team**. Balancing training, coursework, and work has taught me discipline, structure, and how to operate under pressure. (Airport security is always exciting with the metal rods in my shins.) :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

I love learning, building, and uncovering the story behind the numbers. One quote that has always stayed with me is:

> *“I know one thing: that I know nothing.”* — Socrates

It reminds me to stay curious, ask better questions, and keep growing.
