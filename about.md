# About Me

I am a data driven individual who is always looking for interesting questions to answer. Much of my work is theory driven, where I focus on understanding people, institutions, and the dynamics behind behavior. I ask how and why something is happening and what it means in a broader context. At the same time, my training is also predictive, where I focus on detecting patterns, coding, and the technical side of problem solving. I ask what the patterns are, whether we can predict them, and how accurate those predictions can be. This combination is not something you see very often, and it allows me to approach problems from multiple lenses. I am able to bridge the world of theory and context with the world of coding, modeling, and pattern detection. 

I have had many opportunities to present results, discuss findings, and offer recommendations based on my analyses and modeling work. Some of the projects I have completed include analyzing mental health observational data and identifying geographic hotspots using spatial methods. I have also worked with nonprofit financial data to understand how different thresholds influence a foundation’s funding guidelines.


I am currently working on a project that uses YouTube gaming engagement data to understand what makes certain videos stand out. Alongside that project, I am studying how foundations are responding to the current political and economic environment and how they communicate those responses publicly.

In addition to my academic and research work, I am also a student athlete on the UW Milwaukee women’s track and field team. This experience has shaped my work ethic, discipline, and ability to manage time effectively while balancing demanding commitments.

I am always looking for new challenges and ways to expand my skills. A quote from Socrates that has always stayed with me is “*I only know one thing, and that is that I know nothing*,” because it pushes me to keep asking questions and continue growing.
