<hr class="hr-cute">

<div class="about-box">

I am a data driven individual who is always looking for interesting questions to answer. Much of my work is theory driven, where I focus on understanding people, institutions, and the dynamics behind behavior. I ask how and why something is happening and what it means in a broader context. At the same time, my training is also predictive, where I focus on detecting patterns, coding, and the technical side of problem solving. I ask what the patterns are, whether we can predict them, and how accurate those predictions can be.
<br><br>

I’ve worked across research, analytics, and even sales roles, building surveys, analyzing nonprofit financial patterns, mapping crisis-call hotspots, studying political behavior, building CRM systems, producing scenario analyses, and translating findings into insights people can use. I’ve used tools like R, SPSS, ArcGIS, Python, and SQL, and I love work that blends technical depth with real-world impact.

<br><br>

<strong>Right now, I’m working on two major projects:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Analyzing YouTube gaming engagement to understand what makes certain videos stand out—using statistical modeling, feature engineering, and machine learning.</li>
  <li>Studying how philanthropic foundations respond to political and economic uncertainty, including how they communicate publicly through statements, themes, and strategic choices.</li>
</ul>

In addition to my academic and research work, I am also a student athlete on the UW–Milwaukee women’s track and field team. This experience has shaped my work ethic, discipline, and ability to manage time effectively while balancing demanding commitments.

<br><br>

I am always looking for new challenges and ways to expand my skills. A quote from Socrates that has always stayed with me is

<blockquote>
  <i>“I only know one thing, and that is I know nothing.”</i>
</blockquote>

because it pushes me to keep asking questions and continue growing.
